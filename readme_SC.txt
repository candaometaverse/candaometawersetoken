Pease note that if you seal group you cannot reduce its balances via set balance.
So deals there are sealed. but maybe you can add something but no take away. REschedule is possible.

Also u cannot delete sealed group.
You can add dao members you cannot remove them, after sealing dao you cannot add more mombers

Dao members seal the deals , but it is owner who set them in contracts.
